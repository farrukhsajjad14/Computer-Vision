# Computer-Vision
# Repository Overview

This repository contains a simple project demonstrating the use of OpenCV to load and display images. It includes the following components:

## Folder Structure

- `files/`
  - `image.py`: A Python script that uses OpenCV to load and display an image.
- `images/`
  - `1.jpg`: An example image.
  - `2.jpg`: Another example image.
  - `3.jpg`: Another example image.
## `Files/` Folder

The `Files` folder contains a Python script named `image.py`. This script uses the OpenCV library to load and display an image. The script demonstrates basic image loading functionality with OpenCV.

### `image.py`:

This script performs the following actions:
1. Loads an image from the `images/` folder.
2. Displays the loaded image in a window.

## `images/` Folder

The `images` folder contains three example image files:
- `1.jpg`: This image shows a roadside view.
- `2.jpg`: This image shows the leafs of a tree with autum effect.
- `3.jpg`: This image shows the beautiful tile work alongside of a waterpool.
